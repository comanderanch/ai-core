# scripts
Description for the scripts directory.

# Scripts

This directory contains all helper scripts used to run, test, train, or maintain the AI system.

## Purpose
- Automate repetitive tasks like bootstrapping, testing, or memory cleanup.
- Serve as a glue layer between components (engine, tokenizer, memory).
- Support development, deployment, and debugging workflows.

## Typical Scripts (Planned)
- `train.sh` – Runs a full training cycle.
- `start.sh` – Boots up the AI system in the desired state.
- `reset.sh` – Clears dynamic memory or session logs.
- `debug.py` – Tools for inspecting state and internal variables.
- `upgrade.py` – Handles evolutionary jumps or patch routines.

## Notes
Scripts should be modular and well-commented.  
Avoid hardcoding paths; use relative paths and environment configs where possible.

Scripts should be executable (`chmod +x`) and tested in isolation before inclusion in the main workflow.
