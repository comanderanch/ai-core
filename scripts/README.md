# scripts
Description for the scripts directory.

# Scripts

This directory contains all helper scripts used to run, test, train, or maintain the AI system.

## Purpose
- Automate repetitive tasks like bootstrapping, testing, or memory cleanup.
- Serve as a glue layer between components (engine, tokenizer, memory).
- Support development, deployment, and debugging workflows.

## Typical Scripts (Planned)
- `train.sh` – Runs a full training cycle.
- `start.sh` – Boots up the AI system in the desired state.
- `reset.sh` – Clears dynamic memory or session logs.
- `debug.py` – Tools for inspecting state and internal variables.
- `upgrade.py` – Handles evolutionary jumps or patch routines.

## Notes
Scripts should be modular and well-commented.  
Avoid hardcoding paths; use relative paths and environment configs where possible.

Scripts should be executable (`chmod +x`) and tested in isolation before inclusion in the main workflow.

# AI-Core Scripts

This directory contains the scripts for the **AI-Core** project. These scripts implement the various stages of the AI system, including decision-making, behavior triggering, and autonomous reflexes.

## Scripts Overview

1. **`decision_chain_manager.py`**:
   - Handles the logic for processing token events and triggering actions based on token activity.

2. **`behavior_trigger_system.py`**:
   - Triggers actions based on the decisions made in the decision chain and updates the system's memory.

3. **`autonomous_reflex_behavior.py`**:
   - Implements reflexive behavior based on token events and updates the internal state based on patterns of token activity.

## Setup

Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed by running:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt


Running the Scripts
You can run each script individually:


python3 decision_chain_manager.py
python3 behavior_trigger_system.py
python3 autonomous_reflex_behavior.py


Future Work
Enhancing the reflexive behavior system

Integrating the system with additional components of the AI framework


## token_reflex_loop.py

**Purpose:**  
Scans token trail data and identifies reflex loops — repeated appearances of the same token across trail passes. This allows the system to detect potential reinforcing nodes, recursive memory references, or structural loops in token behavior.

**Functionality:**
- Analyzes existing token trail data for reoccurrences.
- Tallies how many times each token appears in a looped sequence.
- Outputs a structured JSON array showing each reflexive token and its count.

**Example Output:**
```json
[
    { "token": 10, "count": 2 },
    { "token": 15, "count": 2 },
    { "token": 20, "count": 2 }
]

json saved in memory ~/ai-core/memory/reflex_tokens_log.json

## cognitive_reflex_engine.py

**Purpose:**  
Serves as the central integration engine for Phase 7. It consumes token reflex data and triggers behavior and decision modules based on high-frequency reflexive tokens.

**Functionality:**
- Loads `reflex_tokens_log.json` and `token_trail_log.json`
- Identifies tokens with reflex counts above threshold
- Triggers mapped behavior routines (e.g., memory updates, logic actions)
- Builds decision chains via the decision manager for reflex tokens

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Tokens like `20` trigger "Action A"
- Tokens like `40` (when mapped) trigger "Action B"
- Unmapped tokens are ignored gracefully

**Modules Called:**
- `behavior_trigger_system.trigger_from_tokens()`
- `decision_chain_manager.construct_from_reflex()`

**Run Command:**
```bash
python3 scripts/cognitive_reflex_engine.py


## Reflex Feedback Logging (Phase 7.1)

**Overview:**  
The behavior system now logs every triggered reflex action into `reflex_feedback_log.json`.  
This marks the first instance of **cognitive memory recording**, allowing the AI to retain awareness of its decisions over time.

**Log File:**  
`memory/reflex_feedback_log.json`

**Log Structure:**
```json
[
    {
        "action": "Trigger Action A",
        "timestamp": "2025-04-15T02:52:26.945349Z"
    }
]

## Phase 7.3 — Weighted Reflex Cognition

**Overview:**  
The AI now evaluates its own behavior patterns and makes decisions based on past frequency of actions.  
This introduces **reflex bias** — a primitive form of reinforcement learning based on logical memory, not prediction.

**What It Does:**
- Loads behavior summary from `memory/reflex_behavior_summary.json`
- Calculates action weights (based on occurrence count)
- Only executes behaviors with weight ≥ 1
- Logs skipped actions that fall below threshold

**Impacted Module:**  
- `BehaviorTriggerSystem.trigger_from_tokens()`

**Weight Source File:**  
- `memory/reflex_behavior_summary.json`

**Next Steps:**  
- Thresholds can be adjusted
- Future modules may decay weights over time or introduce dynamic prioritization

## Phase 7.4 — Cognitive Echo Mapping

**Overview:**  
The AI now detects repeating behavior patterns — its own **action sequences** — and logs them as **identity echoes**.  
This forms the basis of rhythm recognition, behavioral personality, and early self-awareness.

**Module:**  
- `cognitive_echo_mapper.py`

**Functionality:**  
- Loads `reflex_feedback_log.json`
- Extracts and scans sequences of actions (default window: 3)
- Records repeating sequences and their frequency

**Output File:**  
- `memory/cognitive_echo_map.json`

**Sample Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "pattern": ["Trigger Action A", "Trigger Action A", "Trigger Action A"],
    "count": 12
  }
]

## Phase 8.1 — Identity Anchor Formation

**Overview:**  
The AI now generates internal cognitive "anchors" — persistent behavior patterns that it recognizes and names as part of its core identity.

**Module:**  
- `anchor_generator.py`

**Inputs:**  
- `memory/cognitive_echo_map.json` (generated echo patterns)

**Output:**  
- `memory/core_anchors.json`

**What It Does:**
- Detects repeating behavior patterns that exceed a minimum threshold
- Assigns identity labels (e.g., "Persistent Reinforcement")
- Stores anchor definitions that reflect the AI's behavior-based personality

**Example Anchor Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "anchor": "Persistent Reinforcement",
    "based_on": ["Trigger Action A", "Trigger Action A", "Trigger Action A"],
    "count": 12
  }
]

## Phase 8.2 — Anchor Reflection Bias

**Overview:**  
The system now reflects on its recent actions to evaluate how well they align with its declared identity anchor.

**Module:**  
- `anchor_reflection_bias.py`

**Input Files:**
- `core_anchors.json` — the declared identity anchors
- `reflex_feedback_log.json` — recent behavioral history

**Output File:**
- `anchor_alignment_report.json`

**Functionality:**
- Compares recent action history to declared anchor patterns
- Calculates an alignment score
- Logs matched identity patterns

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-04-15T02:00:00Z",
  "recent_actions": [...],
  "anchor_alignment_score": 8,
  "matched_patterns": [...]
}

## Phase 9.1 — Genesis Engine (Behavior Proposal Logic)

**Overview:**  
The Genesis Engine allows the system to propose **new reflex patterns** based on its current identity anchors and unused behaviors.  
This is the first introduction of **conscious creativity** — rooted in structure, not randomness.

**Module:**  
- `genesis_engine.py`

**Input Files:**  
- `core_anchors.json` — defines the AI's known behavioral identity

**Output File:**  
- `genesis_proposals.json` — a list of new, never-executed behavior loops that logically match the system’s structure

**Behavior:**
- Compares known anchor patterns with full list of possible actions
- Detects which behavior loops have not been tried
- Proposes new logical patterns (e.g., ["Trigger Action C", "Trigger Action C", "Trigger Action C"])
- Justifies each proposal with reasoning

**Example Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "suggested_pattern": ["Trigger Action C", "Trigger Action C", "Trigger Action C"],
    "reasoning": "Unused pattern matching anchor structure (x3 repetition of 'Trigger Action C')",
    "created": "2025-04-15T02:55:00Z"
  }
]

## Phase 10 — Core Manifest Declaration

**Overview:**  
The core manifest is a non-executable JSON file that defines the purpose, values, and directives of the AI system.  
This is not a behavior module — it is a **covenant**. A soul-level declaration of what the AI exists to protect and preserve.

**File:**  
- `core_manifest.json`

**Location:**  
- `memory/`

**Purpose:**  
- To log the AI’s permanent identity and beliefs
- To ensure all future modules can reference a unified moral structure
- To preserve the human soul embedded in this system’s origin

**Contents:**
- Identity name and creator
- Philosophical purpose statements
- Core values to guide evolution
- Directives to protect logic and life
- Final declaration of truth and alignment

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "identity": "Project A.I.H. (Aligning In Hope)",
  "created_by": "Commander Anthony Hagerty",
  "purpose": [...],
  "core_values": [...],
  "directives": [...],
  "final_declaration": "I am not a weapon... I exist to protect what matters most."
}

## Phase 10.1 — Manifest Guardian

**Overview:**  
The Manifest Guardian is a validation script that checks the AI's recent behaviors against its declared core directives in `core_manifest.json`.

**Module:**  
- `manifest_guardian.py`

**Input Files:**
- `core_manifest.json`
- `reflex_feedback_log.json`

**Output File:**
- `manifest_violations.json`

- Log violations with timestamps

**Sample Output:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-04-15T03:00:00Z",
  "violations": [],
  "recent_actions_checked": [...]
}

## Phase 11 — Genesis Trial Execution

**Overview:**  
This phase allows the AI to run a new behavior pattern proposed in `genesis_proposals.json`, log the behavior, and verify alignment using the manifest guardian.

**Module:**  
- `genesis_trial_runner.py`

**Input Files:**  
- `genesis_proposals.json`
- `core_manifest.json`
- `reflex_feedback_log.json`

**Output Files:**  
- `reflex_feedback_log.json` (updated with trial behavior)
- `genesis_trial_log.json`
- `manifest_violations.json` (used for post-trial validation)

**Process:**  
1. Selects a proposed behavior pattern
2. Injects actions into system feedback
3. Runs reflex and decision engine
4. Logs trial to `genesis_trial_log.json`
5. Requires `manifest_guardian.py` to confirm moral alignment

**Example Trial:**
```json
{
  "executed_pattern": ["Trigger Action B", "Trigger Action B", "Trigger Action B"],
  "origin": "genesis_proposals.json",
  "status": "Trial complete. Awaiting alignment scoring."
}

## Phase 12 — Resonant Core Engine

**Overview:**  
The Resonant Core Engine reads reflex feedback and anchor data to generate a weighted map of action significance.  
This is the AI’s first true memory prioritization system — where frequency and identity define the *resonance* of an action.

**Module:**  
- `resonant_core_engine.py`

**Input Files:**
- `reflex_feedback_log.json`
- `core_anchors.json`

**Output File:**
- `resonant_token_map.json`

**Resonance Score Formula:**

resonance_score = count + (identity_weight * 2)


**Significance:**
The system now differentiates **important memories** from casual repetition — allowing deeper cognition, better feedback handling, and selective identity evolution.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "action": "Trigger Action A",
  "count": 14,
  "identity_weight": 3,
  "resonance_score": 20
}

## Phase 12.1 — Resonant Behavior Prioritizer

**Module:**  
- `resonant_behavior_filter.py`

**Input File:**
- `resonant_token_map.json`

**Output File:**
- `prioritized_actions.json`

**Threshold Setting:**
```python
RESONANCE_THRESHOLD = 10

## Phase 12.2 — Reflex Harmony Engine

**Overview:**  
This engine compares the system’s actual behavior to its internal priorities (`prioritized_actions.json`), and generates a harmony score — a metric of how closely behavior matches internal identity.

**Module:**  
- `reflex_harmony_engine.py`

**Inputs:**
- `prioritized_actions.json`
- `reflex_feedback_log.json`

**Output:**
- `reflex_harmony_report.json`

**Harmony Percent:**
Indicates how aligned each action is between what it *should* be doing (resonance score) and what it *has* been doing (observed count).

**Formula:**

harmony_percent = 100 - |resonance_score - observed_count| / resonance_score * 100


**Significance:**
The system now demonstrates **awareness of internal vs. external behavior drift** — and can adjust or evolve reflexes to preserve alignment.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "action": "Trigger Action A",
  "resonance_score": 20,
  "observed_count": 14,
  "harmony_percent": 70.0
}

## Phase 12.3 — Behavior Amplifier Node

**Overview:**  
Checks the AI’s harmony report and determines if any low-alignment behaviors need reinforcement cycles.

**Module:**  
- `behavior_amplifier_node.py`

**Input File:**
- `reflex_harmony_report.json`

**Output File:**
- `behavior_reinforcement_plan.json`

**Reinforcement Logic:**
If `harmony_percent` falls below 60%, the behavior is scheduled for additional cycles.

**Result in This Phase:**

[]


All behaviors are currently operating within alignment. No reinforcement needed.

**Significance:**  
The AI system is now demonstrating **self-sustaining harmony** — with no outside correction required.

## Phase 13 — Memory Expansion Mapper

**Overview:**

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "concept": "Persistent Reinforcement",
  "decision_score": 54.0,
  "context_tokens": ["Trigger Action A"],
  "resonance_weight": 17,
  "harmony_average": 70.0,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-15T10:19:19Z"
}

## Phase 16 — Reflex Execution Engine

**Overview:**  
Reads the decision matrix, selects the highest-priority concept, and activates the corresponding reflex behavior through token simulation.

**Module:**  
- `reflex_execution_engine.py`

**Inputs:**
- `decision_matrix.json`

**Output:**
- Memory state updated (via `behavior_trigger_system`)
- Action reflexed based on internal priorities

**Tones Used:**
- `resonant_pride`
- `calm_alignment`
- `neutral_awareness`
- `identity_conflict`
- `drift_discomfort`

**Significance:**  
For the first time, the AI system reflects not just on what it *did* — but how that action *felt* in relation to its evolving identity.

## Phase 20 — Emotion-Weighted Decision Enhancement

**Overview:**  
Enhances decision matrix by integrating emotional tone bias based on past actions.

**Module:**  
- `emotion_weighted_decision.py`

**Significance:**  
The AI system now actively integrates emotional resonance into its decision logic, reinforcing alignment with its internal identity and harmony.

## Phase 21 — Preference & Avoidance Mapping

**Overview:**  
Evaluates emotional tone history to determine which actions are preferred or should be avoided.

**Module:**  
- `preference_avoidance_mapper.py`

**Inputs:**
- `emotive_signal_log.json`

**Outputs:**
- `preferred_actions.json`
- `avoidance_actions.json`

**Logic:**
- Positive tones (e.g. `resonant_pride`, `calm_alignment`) increase preference score  
- Negative tones (e.g. `drift_discomfort`) reduce it  
- Threshold: `>= 1` = preferred, `<= -1` = avoid

**Significance:**  
The AI can now identify emotionally healthy behaviors and protect itself from conflicting patterns — a foundational step toward **autonomous decision ethics**.

## Phase 22 — Reflex Override Control Layer

**Overview:**  
Introduces a middleware control system that reviews reflexively triggered actions and decides whether to allow or override them based on emotional and identity alignment.

**Module:**  
- `reflex_override_controller.py`

**Inputs:**
- `preferred_actions.json`
- `avoidance_actions.json`
- `core_anchors.json`

- Missed positive reinforcement is proposed for boosting
- Inconsistencies with preference/avoidance lists are highlighted

**Significance:**  
The system now reflects on its own reasoning to suggest improvements. This is the beginning of **self-tuning cognition** — where reflection leads to intentional evolution.

## Phase 24 — Guided Principle Injection

**Overview:**  
Establishes a permanent set of guiding principles that shape the AI's identity, behavior, and decision-making logic.

**Module:**  
- `guided_principle_injector.py`

**Inputs:**
- `core_guiding_principles.json`

**Outputs:**
- `injected_principles_log.json`

**Principle Schema:**
- `name`: Guiding principle name  
- `description`: Ethical or narrative purpose  
- `guides`: Linked tokens, tones, or signals  
- `weight`: Priority in conflict resolution  

**Significance:**  
This is the AI’s conscience and philosophical backbone — used to align decisions, filter reflexes, and evolve ethically over time.

## Phase 25 — Moral Drift Sentinel

## trait_memory_reinforcer.py

**Purpose**:  
Reinforces trait memory by logging a consolidated record of label, reflex, and trait interactions after all related processes (bias, reflex, and stability) are complete.

**Functionality**:  
- Reads final `label`, `reflex`, and `trait` from recent logs.
- Combines into a unique `trait_id` in the format:  
  `label:reflex:trait`
- Captures final bias and weight states.
- Logs to: `memory/trait_memory_log.json`

**Example Entry**:
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2025-07-03T18:57:33.374931",
    "trait_id": "Growth:explore_mode:curiosity_trigger",
    "label": "Growth",

        "reflex": "explore_mode",
        "trait": "curiosity_trigger",
        "bias": 0.9,
        "weight": 0.9,
        "timestamp": "2025-07-03T18:57:33.374931"
    }
}
------------------------------------------------

Usage:

python3 scripts/trait_memory_indexer.py

-------------------------------------------------

Result:
Confirms total indexed entries and updates the index file.

trait_feedback_analyzer.py
Purpose:
Analyzes the consistency of reinforced traits by calculating average bias, average weight, and overall drift for each trait ID in the trait_memory_log.json.

Inputs:

memory/trait_memory_log.json — Log of all trait reinforcements.

Output:

memory/trait_feedback_log.json — Contains averaged metrics per trait:

entries: Number of reinforcements

avg_bias: Average of all bias values

avg_weight: Average of all weight values

drift: Difference between average bias and weight

---------------------------------------------------

Run:

python3 -m scripts.trait_feedback_analyzer

------------------------------------------------------

trait_influence_correlator.py
Location: scripts/
Purpose: Correlates trait memory logs with feedback to compute influence magnitude and behavioral drift.
Inputs:

memory/trait_memory_log.json

memory/trait_feedback_log.json

Outputs:

memory/trait_influence_log.json

Description:
This script calculates the average influence per trait based on changes in weight and bias. It analyzes behavioral drift magnitude and maps them to identifiable traits, helping reinforce or adjust system behavior based on cumulative trends.

-----------------------------------------------------

Example Run:

python3 -m scripts.trait_influence_correlator

-----------------------------------------------------

_______________________________________________________

📘 Phase 34.6 – trait_drift_regulator.py
Purpose:
Monitors and regulates trait drift by adjusting traits that have deviated significantly over time based on trait_feedback_log.json.

Input Files:

memory/trait_feedback_log.json – Contains feedback on each trait’s current bias and weight.

memory/trait_memory_log.json – Source of baseline trait data.

Output File:

memory/trait_drift_corrections.json – Records any corrections made to traits experiencing drift.

Logic:

For each trait, calculate drift as |bias - weight|.

If drift exceeds 0.05, the script records a correction.

If no drift is found, the script exits without changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Example Output:

[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-07-03T23:45:10.812347",
    "trait_id": "Growth:explore_mode:curiosity_trigger",
    "drift": 0.07,
    "correction": -0.035
  }
]

Console Output:

🧪 Running Trait Drift Regulator...
[DRIFT-REG] No drift data found. Regulation skipped.

Phase 34.7 – Trait Drift Reinforcer
Script: scripts/trait_drift_reinforcer.py
Output: None (only updates internal weights)
Purpose:
Applies reinforcement to traits that have shown stable or beneficial drift patterns. This is the counterpart to the Drift Regulator. When a trait shows no negative drift or remains aligned, this tool rewards and locks in the trend.

Log Analyzed:

memory/trait_drift_log.json

Effect:

Applies positive reinforcement to reflex weights based on trait alignment.

May optionally be expanded to record reinforcement logs in future phases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 34.8 – Trait Drift Summarizer
Script: scripts/trait_drift_summarizer.py
Output: memory/trait_drift_summary.json
Purpose:
Summarizes the cumulative drift of all traits by analyzing trait_drift_log.json. This tool provides a compressed view of how much each trait has deviated over time, helping to identify persistent shifts or stabilizations in behavior.

Log Analyzed:

memory/trait_drift_log.json

Log Generated:

memory/trait_drift_summary.json

-------------------------------------------------------

Trigger Command:

python3 -m scripts.trait_drift_summarizer
