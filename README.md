# ai-core

This project is the starting point for AI-Core.

## Purpose

- Set up a clean, minimal project structure.
- Initialize Git version control.
- Push to the remote GitHub repository.
- Begin with empty folders and placeholder `README.md` files.

No code or functionality has been added yet. This is the foundational setup only.

# AI-Core: Custom Token-Based AI Framework

Welcome to the AI-Core project -  a full-stack custom AI architecture focused on tokenization through RGB, hue, frequency, and influence vectors.

---

## üîß System Status

The following subsystems have been added and actively developed:

- `tokenizer/`  
  ‚û§ Handles RGB + Hue + Frequency ‚Üí Binary token generation  
  ‚û§ Includes `color_hue_tokenizer.cpp`, `full_color_tokens.csv`

- `ai-llm/`  
  ‚û§ Hosts the Minimal LLM neural engine  
  ‚û§ Now supports 82D input tokens with local influence mapping  
  ‚û§ Contains training loops, cosine scoring, PCA visualizations, and inference tools

- `training/`  
  ‚û§ Stores token training pair definitions  
  ‚û§ Will evolve into intent/semantic pair training

## üß† Summary

> This project is building an experimental AI from the ground up ‚Äî  
> using color-based binary tokenization instead of text-token embeddings.

Every phase is tracked via Git commits.  
For module-specific updates and changelogs, see the `README.md` inside each folder.

## Recent Updates

- Token memory trail logging now active (Phase 5.7)
- Anchor influence now blended during LLM training (Phase 5.6)
- See respective folders (`ai-llm/`, `tokenizer/`) for more.
