# Tokenizer

This module handles the conversion of raw input (text, audio, or signals) into structured tokens.

## Purpose
- Translate external data into the AI's internal language.
- Enable color-based token representation for increased token resolution.
- Support reverse-tokenization for AI-generated output.

## Modes
- `color_mode` – Primary system using color frequency, hue, and intensity as tokens.
- `text_mode` – Fallback for traditional word/byte tokenization.
- `hybrid_mode` – Optional blend of color and text token layers.

## Components
- `tokenizer.py` / `tokenizer.cpp` – Main logic for encoding/decoding.
- `mappings/` – Data files for color-word associations and spectrum definitions.
- `utils/` – Helpers for token collision checks, token stats, and normalization.

## Notes
This is a critical layer. The quality and structure of tokenization directly influence the AI’s reasoning ability.  
Color token uniqueness is vital — collisions are logged and flagged automatically.
