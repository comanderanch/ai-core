# logs
Description for the logs directory.

# Logs

This directory stores logs generated by the AI system during runtime.

## Purpose
- Track AI decisions, state changes, memory calls, and tokenizer usage.
- Debug system behavior and identify anomalies or crashes.
- Provide historical insight into evolving behavior or thought patterns.

## Suggested Log Types
- `ai-engine.log` – Main logic loop output and decision history.
- `memory.log` – Reads/writes to memory nodes and recall accuracy.
- `tokenizer.log` – Input token breakdowns and token assignment metadata.
- `errors.log` – Crashes, warnings, or unexpected events.

## Notes
Logs may grow quickly — consider setting rotation or max size limits.  
Important logs should be backed up if being used for training or analysis.
