Description for the ai-engine directory.

# AI Engine

This is the core logic layer of the AI system.  
It handles the thinking, decision-making, and state transitions.

## Purpose
The AI Engine is responsible for:

- Interpreting tokenized input (color-based or traditional)
- Generating output decisions or actions
- Interfacing with memory nodes and feedback loops
- Switching between processing modes or internal "states"

## Components (Planned)
- `core.cpp` / `core.py` ‚Äì Main processing loop
- `state_manager.*` ‚Äì Controls attention, context, and AI modes
- `evolution.*` ‚Äì Handles self-evolving routines and refinements
- `hooks/` ‚Äì Optional logic injections or runtime modifiers

## Notes
This layer stays mostly "logic-pure" ‚Äî no UI, no storage, just pure reasoning.  
Everything else (memory, tokenizer, configs) feeds into this.

## üß† Journal Update ‚Äì Phase 33 Summary

**Checkpoint:** Reflex Conditioning + Bias Injection  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  

- Label ‚ûù Trait ‚ûù Reflex mapping system added.
- Structured training now uses `training_set.csv`.
- Reflex triggers are logged and analyzed for weight adjustments.
- Memory bias logic supports dynamic reflex reinforcement.

All modules updated, logged, and version-controlled.

### Phase 33.7 ‚Äì Reflex Drift Handler

- Implemented `reflex_drift_handler.py` to calculate and log drift between bias and reflex response.
- Output stored in `memory/reflex_drift_log.json`.
- This module enables tracking of long-term behavioral accuracy and adaptation need.
