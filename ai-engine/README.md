# AI Engine

This is the core logic layer of the AI system.  
It handles the thinking, decision-making, and state transitions.

## Purpose
The AI Engine is responsible for:

- Interpreting tokenized input (color-based or traditional)
- Generating output decisions or actions
- Interfacing with memory nodes and feedback loops
- Switching between processing modes or internal "states"

## Components (Planned)
- `core.cpp` / `core.py` – Main processing loop
- `state_manager.*` – Controls attention, context, and AI modes
- `evolution.*` – Handles self-evolving routines and refinements
- `hooks/` – Optional logic injections or runtime modifiers

## Notes
This layer stays mostly "logic-pure" — no UI, no storage, just pure reasoning.  
Everything else (memory, tokenizer, configs) feeds into this.
