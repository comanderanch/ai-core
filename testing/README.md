# testing
Description for the testing directory.

# Testing

This directory is dedicated to validating each component of the AI system.

## Purpose
- Ensure stability, accuracy, and integrity of logic across updates.
- Catch regressions early with focused unit and integration tests.
- Simulate real-world input/output to verify behavior.

## Structure
- `unit/` – Tests for isolated functions or modules (e.g. tokenizer, state_manager).
- `integration/` – Tests that check interaction between components (e.g. tokenizer + memory).
- `mock_data/` – Sample token streams, memory snapshots, or logs for replay.

## Notes
Tests should be:
- Easy to run from a single command (`run_tests.sh`)
- Logged to the `/logs/` directory with timestamps
- Able to pass or fail clearly (exit codes, color-coded outputs)

Coverage reports and test performance logs can help optimize development cycles.
