# Training Module – AI-Core

This folder contains manual training pair definitions used to test the minimal LLM with custom color tokens.

### Files:
- `training_pairs.py` – A list of manually defined (input index, target index) training pairs. These map tokens from `full_color_tokens.csv` to simulate early-stage language patterns.

### Purpose:
To validate that token inputs from the custom CSV can flow through the minimal model, and that predictable outputs are produced from structured input pairs.

This is the first step toward full-scale LLM training using color-based token systems.
