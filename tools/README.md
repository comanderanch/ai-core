# tools
Description for the tools directory.

# Tools

This directory contains utilities that support development, debugging, and performance tuning.

## Purpose
- Provide standalone helper scripts for inspecting, testing, or modifying AI subsystems.
- Accelerate development with reusable functions and diagnostic tools.
- Isolate non-core logic that doesn’t belong in the main engine.

## Contents (Examples)
- `inspector.py` – View token streams, memory traces, or reasoning chains.
- `profiler.py` – Benchmark timing and CPU/memory usage per module.
- `patcher.py` – Inject or modify parts of the engine during live sessions.
- `validator.py` – Check token integrity, config sanity, and memory references.

## Notes
These tools are optional but highly recommended for serious development and debugging.  
They are isolated to avoid interfering with core engine logic and allow safe experimentation.

### Token Cluster Detector

**File:** `token_cluster_detector.py`  
**Purpose:** Analyzes cosine similarity between color tokens to identify natural clusters.  
**Output:** `token_clusters.png` — A visual map showing cluster formations and alignment paths between tokens.  
**Notes:** Used for identifying emergent token relationships and validating anchor influence on spatial structure.
